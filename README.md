### Instructions

The compiled program must be called from the command line. The program does not take any CLI arguments.

#### Input
The program receives input from the user through the terminal. The first input taken from the user is requesting the relative file path of a file. This file must be in the specified format from the assignment. The file must contain the data regarding the other users. The second input is asking the user for their name. Then the latitude, longitude, and altitude are taken all in one line. The three values must be comma and space separated (eg. 1234, 74567, 12345). Then the user's time in nanoseconds is entered.

#### Output

Based on the given input in the file and in the terminal, the program will output the name of the closest other user. Along with the name of the other user that is closest, the program also gives the position of said closest user.
